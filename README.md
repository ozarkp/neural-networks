# neural-networks
Implementations of various neural networks from the CSCI 252: Neural Networks (and Graphical Models) course during the Fall of 2016 at Washington and Lee University

## Example usage
Excluding the optical_flow-image_convolution example, all neural networks should be used with Python3. Open-CV does not work in Python3 without extra work.
